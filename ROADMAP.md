# Jarvis AI - Strategic Improvement Roadmap 🚀

This document outlines the strategic vision for evolving Jarvis from a personal assistant into a secure, autonomous AGI system ("True Jarvis").

## 🛡️ 1. Security Enhancements (Priority: High)

To make Jarvis suitable for enterprise or sensitive personal use, security must be paramount.

### A. Authentication & Authorization

- **[ ] JWT-based Auth:** Replace simple local storage check with robust JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
- **[ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles (e.g., `Admin`, `User`, `Guest`). Only `Admin` can execute system commands or file deletions.
- **[ ] 2FA Integration:** Add optional Two-Factor Authentication via TOTP (Authy/Google Authenticator) for critical actions (e.g., sending emails, deleting files).

### B. Data Privacy & Encryption

- **[ ] Local Data Encryption:** Encrypt the `jarvis-memory.json` and local Vector DB files using AES-256 so data is unreadable if the file is stolen.
- **[ ] Secure Key Management:** Move API keys from plain `.env` text to the OS Keychain (Windows Credential Manager / macOS Keychain) using `keyring` python library.
- **[ ] Audit Logging:** detailed, tamper-evident logs of every action Jarvis performs (e.g., "Deleted file X at timestamp Y").

### C. Sandboxing "True Jarvis" Mode

- **[ ] Virtualized Execution:** When running potentially dangerous scripts (e.g., Python code generated by the agent), run them inside a Docker container or a restricted sandbox to prevent accidental system damage.

## 🧠 2. Advanced Feature Expansion

### A. "The Hive Mind" (Multi-Agent Swarms)

*Currently partial.*

- **[ ] CrewAI Integration:** Fully implement the "Proactive Core".
  - **Researcher Agent:** Scours the web for deep answers.
  - **Planner Agent:** Breaks down complex goals into steps.
  - **Coder Agent:** Writes and tests code autonomously.
- **[ ] Parallel Execution:** Allow multiple agents to work simultaneously in the background while you chat with the main Jarvis interface.

### B. Omniscient Memory (Vector Database)

*Currently using local JSON/InMemory.*

- **[ ] Supabase / ChromaDB Integration:** Store millions of memories, documents, and code snippets.
- **[ ] Semantic Search:** Allow Jarvis to "recall" vague concepts (e.g., "What was that project I mentioned last week about fusion?").
- **[ ] Document Digestion:** Drag-and-drop PDF/Word/Text files for Jarvis to read, index, and answer questions about.

### C. Vision & Perception

- **[ ] Screen Analysis:** Give Jarvis "eyes" using `pyautogui` + Vision LLM (e.g., GPT-4o or Llava). "Jarvis, look at my screen and tell me what error this is."
- **[ ] Webcam Integration:** User presence detection. "Pause music when I leave the desk."

### D. Deep OS Integration

- **[ ] Native App Control:** Use Accessibility APIs to click buttons in non-API apps (Spotify, Photoshop, etc.).
- **[ ] File System Watcher:** "Jarvis, watch my Downloads folder and automatically organize any new PDF into Documents."

## ⚡ 3. Architecture & Reliability

### A. Performance

- **[ ] Rust Core:** Rewrite performance-critical modules (like the wake-word listener) in Rust for millisecond latency.
- **[ ] WebSocket Optimization:** Implement binary message formats (Protobuf) for faster voice/video streaming.

### B. Deployment

- **[ ] One-Click Installer:** Create an `.msi` or `.dmg` installer that bundles Python/Node so users don't need to install *anything*.
- **[ ] Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Allow Jarvis to update itself from the GitHub repository automatically.
