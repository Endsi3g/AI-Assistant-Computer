# JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)

> "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy." — Tony Stark

Jarvis isn't just an assistant. He's the brain behind the bench. High-speed, multi-provider AI built to handle the heavy lifting while you focus on the genius work.

## ⚡ Current Loadout

* **Multi-Provider Core**: Seamlessly routes between Ollama (Self-hosted), Groq (Speed), and OpenAI (Premium).
* **True Jarvis Mode**: Complete system control. No hand-holding, just execution.
* **Proactive Memory**: PARA-structured memory system that doesn't forget.
* **Agentic Skills**: Web research, file ops, aircraft tracking, and deep system automation.
* **Responsive UI**: Sleek, cyberpunk-inspired interface that looks as good as it works.

## 🚀 Deployment

One button. That's all you need.

1. **Run `start-jarvis.bat`**.
2. Sit back. It'll handle the venv, dependencies, and servers.
3. Interface opens at `http://localhost:5173`.

*Note: Requires Python 3.10+ and Node.js 18+. Don't make me explain that twice.*

## 🛣️ Roadmap: The Mark Series

We're not done. Not even close.

* **Mark II (Security)**: JWT Auth, OS Keychain encryption, and encrypted memory.
* **Mark III (Vision)**: Screen analysis and real-world perception.
* **Mark IV (Autonomy)**: Full Multi-Agent Swarms for complex background tasks.

Check the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the full strategic vision.
