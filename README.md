# AI-Assistant-for-Computer
You can run this program in your computer and talk with the AI more easily with a GUI.

You have to put the API Key in the .env file.
You can change the voice as you wish from voice_player.py.
You can change the prompt, from gemini.py to customize it.
You can change the stt from voice_recognition.py(as vosk or speec_recognition that's your choice).
You can change the face.png and you can put your own design to feel like it's yours.
You have to run program in main.py

If you have any problem or question, you can tell me this from my YouTube channel (@FatihMakes)
Have fun!
